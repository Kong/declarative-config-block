# Declarative Config Block

This repo contains a proof of concept block that partially renders a Kong declarative configuration file and allows you to remove elements from the config inline. To try them yourself:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kong/declarative-config-block
cd declarative-config-block
yarn 
yarn start
```

When you visit http://localhost:4000 you'll see the following blocks if you're looking at a filename that ends with `.yaml`
